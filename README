The qtpaint package provides a low-level canvas for interactive
statistical graphics. It is a thin layer on top of the QGraphicsView
framework of Qt. Key features include: OpenGL renderer optimized for
statistical graphics, layered buffering strategy for efficient
updates, and rapid querying of graphical elements within a screen
region. Plots may respond to a wide range of user inputs.
